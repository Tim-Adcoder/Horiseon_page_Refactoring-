Hi, 

Please find the site is published at https://tim-adcoder.github.io/Horiseon_page_Refactoring-/

I was given the "Heriseon" webpage for refactoring to make it more accessaible  


1. semantic html elements 

The starter code uses non-semantic tags <div>and<span> in the html file. After refactoring, these are replaced or deleted - if it's unnecessary - by semantic tags, <header>, <main>, <section>, <aside>, <img>, <footer> that shows the logic and meaning of the content. 

2. heading in consequential and logical order and indenpent of styling and positioning


3. icons & images with alt attributes

The original html file contains no alt attributes in all images 

4. id/class 
5. concise descriptive title 
The starder code uses "website" named the page title and "hero" named the <class> attribute for the first image 
6. link functioning 

7. Title elements are concise and descriptive 
he starter code uses


delete unnecessary property/heading in HTML file
deleted lesson tag <class:seo> in header section so that is more logical and effecient. 

deleted HTML element -div - parent heading for the unordered list 

Bonus: 

I have also adjust the mock-up that suitable for a resolution smaller than 768px. I hope this adjustment suits your purpose.
