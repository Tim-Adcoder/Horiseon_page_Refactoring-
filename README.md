## What was your motivation?

By refactoring the page, I'm hoping the this can be more accessible for people with disability, more effcient in internet searching, and easier to read for people reading the code. 

## Why did you build this project? 
Apart from the reasons above, I also want to have a better understanding in the work of web development and able to develop professional website that serve its purpose. 

## What problem does it solve?
In the priciple of not changing the webpage appearance, this refactoring has focused on the follow elements in its html and CSS files to achieve the above goals. 

1. semantic html elements 

The starter code uses non-semantic tags <div>and<span> in the html file. After refactoring, these are replaced or deleted - if it's unnecessary - by semantic tags, <header>, <main>, <section>, <aside>, <img>, <footer> that shows the logic and meaning of the content. 

2. heading in consequential and logical order and indenpent of styling and positioning


3. icons & images with alt attributes

The original html file contains no alt attributes in all images. All alt attributes have added on each images. 

4. id/class 
<id> sector is used to identify a single element and <class> sector is used to identify more than one. Therefore, the motified verision has attempted to suit each sector's purpose.  

5. concise descriptive title 
The starder code uses "website" named the page title and "hero" named the <class> attribute for the first image. They has been changed to "Horiseon" and <digital-marketing-meeting> respectively so that its more concise and descriptive. 

6. link functioning 
All the links are tested and now functioned properly as before, one of the link did not link to the right location of the page.  

7. Title elements are concise and descriptive 
he starter code uses

I have deleted unnecessary property/heading in HTML file.
+ Deleted lesson tag <class:seo> in header section so that is more logical and effecient. 
+ Deleted HTML element -div - parent heading for the unordered list
